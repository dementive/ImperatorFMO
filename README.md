# Imperator: Rome - Full Mechanical Overhaul

How to install:

Method 1 (steam):
Find the mod on the steam workshop and subscribe to it. Then open the game launcher and place the mod last in your playset. You can now play the mod.

Method 2 (manual):
Download this program: https://desktop.github.com/ and install it
Once installed open it and press clone new repo, go to the url tab and put in this: https://github.com/dementive/ImperatorFMO.git
Then for the location, change it to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Imperator\mod\(modname) (navigate it yourself and make sure it doesn't get put in a subfolder)!!!don't use capitilization in the name and manually verify the local path!!! and then press clone.
Next open up the repository on github desktop and go to the "main" branch and fetch from origin twice at the top.
Now finally, go into the mod files, find the file name ImperatorFMO.mod and move this file and ONLY this file 1 folder back with all your other mod files. You should be able to run the mod now.


Method 3 (manual with zip):
If you don't want to mess with git just go to the "Code" section of the repo online and download it as a zip file.
Unzip this into Documents\Paradox Interactive\Imperator\mod\(modname) and follow the above steps to move the mod file where it should be.
I wouldn't reccomend this because you will have to redownload the zip again to get any updates that are made to the repo.
